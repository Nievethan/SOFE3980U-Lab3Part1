## Deliverables:
1. Briefly summarize what you have learned about docker and Kubernetes, including their terminologies and descriptions. <br />
<br />
Docker is a platform that automates the deployment of applications inside containers. These containers come with the application and all the required dependencies to run the application.
Kubernetes are a container orchestration platform developed by Google. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. <br />

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using docker images? <br />
<br />

**Advantages:** <br />
Portability: Ensures applications run consistently across different environments. <br />
Efficiency: Shares the host OS kernel, reducing resource consumption compared to traditional virtual machines. <br />
Scalability: Facilitates easy scaling of applications by deploying multiple container instances. <br />

**Disadvantages:** <br />
Security Concerns: Containers share the host OS kernel, which can pose security risks if not managed properly. <br />
Networking Complexity: Managing container networking, especially in large-scale deployments, can be intricate. <br />
